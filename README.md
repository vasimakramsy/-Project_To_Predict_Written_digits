# -Project_To_Predict_Written_digits

Here am using the well known MNIST dataset so that i can 
train my CNN model.
After training am saving the weights(model) for its future use.
Using Tkniker package to do some GUI interface to get or give a chance to the user to write
the numbers which ever they want to write between 0-9.
As output user can get the output of their written number.
My model can predict one number at a time....
